# Hi, I'm Hao 👋

🎯 **Aspiring Data Engineer** with a background in **Data Science**, one year of **DevOps experience**, and one year of **Data Engineering experience**.  
I enjoy solving problems with data, building scalable pipelines, and learning new technologies.  
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing table tennis 🏓.
